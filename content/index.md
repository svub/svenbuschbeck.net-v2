      The web is a living thing, it's changing all the time. Over the years, I've used  many frameworks, languages, and meta-languages. I've basically grown up with web-development and feel at home on the web. The foundation for each project is a good idea and a powerful framework in combination with top usability/UX and clear/extensible code and infrastructure. I'm a big fan of Vue.js with Typescript, HTML/Pug, Sass/Stylus. I'm more and more dabbling my feet in Web3, bringing crypto and the web together.

      I've entered the crypto space in 2017 and joined the <a href="https://nimiq.com" target="_blank">Nimiq</a> project the same year. I was working on front-end parts (e.g. <a href="https://fastspot.io/ target="_blank">fastspot.io</a>, <a href="https://www.nimiq.com/staking-calculator/" target="_blank">staking calculator</a>) and content creation until mid-2022. During these years I've seen the good and bad of crypto and I can see the big potential that distributed ledger technologycan could bring to our society (Distributed autonomous organizations, decentralized finance, private transactions, sound money, and the power of immutability and trustlessness). And the tech (L1 and L2, L0, ZKPs, side chains, encryption, ...) is simply fascinating.

      What's the point of technology if it doesn't serve the user? This question has been my guiding principle and way of thinking since university. It is the driving force behind finding the optimal trade-off between features, security, performance on the one hand and usability on the other.

      I have a passion for explaining technical topics to curious non-technical people. Over the years, this has driven me to develop my communication and writing skills. I enjoy writing blog posts, leading workshops, and understanding and explaining technology in one-on-one sessions.

I still remember that massive book my brother gave for my twelve's birthday. Back when going online involved a modem and Netscape Communicator. Thanks to the book and some funny ideas in my head as motivation, I learned JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create my first interactive websites in the mid 90s. That was the initial spark that has lead to studying computer science with a mix of graphic design and usability engineering. While hacking away on uni assignments and little open source side projects, I started working on designing and building a CMS for a small web agency to pay my bills. Being curious about living and working abroad, I then took a junior researcher position at the [University of Trento](unitn.it/en) in Italy in 2007. After two years, I changed to work as research engineer at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://dfki.de/en/web) in Germany. I learned a lot during that time but also realized that I'm not a 9-5er office person. Thus, in 2013, I started working as a freelance web technology consultant &amp; developer and gathered experience in marketing, technical writing, and communications. And just before the crypto frenzy was in full swing in 2017, I started my deep dive into blockchain technology and by the end of that year, I joined the [Nimiq Project](https://nimiq.com) as full time contractor. 

Throughout my career, I've experienced a wide range of projects, teams, frameworks, and  management approaches. I worked with privately held companies, universities, research centers, start-ups, as well as NGOs/NPOs. I learned that a) it's important to love what you do, b) that working culture is at least as important as the software stack, c) the importance of project management is often underrated. 

While moving through projects, I also moved through countries and continents and became an avid traveler with a love for refreshing my synapses by immersing into new cultures and ideas. So, during the years I lived in Germany, Italy, Greece, Australia, Taiwan, and Costa Rica and understood what a beautiful and colorful place our little planet is. It's at the core of my personality to seek for harmony within myself, with friends, colleagues, and nature as a whole.
