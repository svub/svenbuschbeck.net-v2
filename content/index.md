    Hi fellow traveler! I'm Sven, I support projects as a web technology consultant, project manager, full-stack developer, and (technical) writer -- worldwide, remote and on-sight. I love applied technologies, believe in the power of Open Source, and have a passion for photography, writing and communication, nature and traveling.

    text: >
      The web is a living thing, it's changing all the time. Over the years, I've used  many frameworks, languages, and meta-languages. I've basically grown up with web-development and feel at home on the web. The foundation for each project is a good idea and a powerful framework in combination with top usability/UX and clear/extensible code and infrastructure. I'm a big fan of Vue.js with Typescript, HTML/Pug, Sass/Stylus. I'm more and more dabbling my feet in Web3, bringing crypto and the web together.

      I've entered the crypto space in 2017 and joined the <a href="https://nimiq.com" target="_blank">Nimiq</a> project the same year. I was working on front-end parts (e.g. <a href="https://fastspot.io/ target="_blank">fastspot.io</a>, <a href="https://www.nimiq.com/staking-calculator/" target="_blank">staking calculator</a>) and content creation until mid-2022. During these years I've seen the good and bad of crypto. There is big potential that distributed ledger technology can bring to our societies &mdash; distributed autonomous organizations, decentralized finance, private transactions, sound money, and the power of immutability and trustlessness just to name a few. And the tech (L1 and L2, L0, ZKPs, side chains, encryption, ...) is simply powerful and fascinating.

      What's the point of technology if it doesn't serve the user? This question has been my guiding principle and way of thinking since university. It is the driving force behind finding the optimal trade-off between features, security, performance on the one hand and usability on the other.

  - title: Content
    text: >
      I have a passion for explaining technical topics to curious non-technical people. Over the years, this has driven me to develop my communication and writing skills. I enjoy writing blog posts, leading workshops, and understanding and explaining technology in one-on-one sessions.
