    Hello there! I'm Sven. I support projects as a web technology consultant, project manager, full-stack developer, and (technical) writer -- working worldwide, both remotely and on-site. I’m passionate about applied technologies, believe strongly in the power of Open Source, and have a deep love for photography, writing, planning, communication, nature, and traveling -- even for bookkeeping.

  - title: Web
    text: >
      The web is constantly evolving, a living and ever-changing ecosystem. Over the years, I've worked with numerous frameworks, languages, and meta-languages. Having grown up alongside the web's development, I feel completely at home here. Every successful project begins with a strong idea, a powerful framework, top-tier usability/UX, and clear, extensible code and infrastructure. I’m a big fan of Vue.js with TypeScript, HTML/Pug, and Sass/Stylus. Recently, I’ve been exploring Web3 technologies.

    text: >
      I entered the DLT space in 2017 joining the <a href="https://nimiq.com" target="_blank">Nimiq</a> project. My work focused on front-end development (e.g., <a href="https://fastspot.io/" target="_blank">Fastspot</a>, <a href="https://www.nimiq.com/staking-calculator/" target="_blank">Staking Calculator</a>) and content creation until mid-2022. During this time, I witnessed both the promise and pitfalls of distributed ledger technology: it has immense potential to transform our societies &mdash; through decentralized finance, distributed autonomous organizations, private transactions, sound money, and the power of immutability and trustlessness, to name a few. The underlying technology (L1, L2, L0, ZKPs, side chains, encryption, etc.) is both powerful and fascinating.

      What’s the point of technology if it doesn’t serve its users? This question has been my guiding principle since my university days. It drives me to find the ideal balance between features, security, performance, and usability.

  - title: Content
    text: >
      I have a passion for breaking down complex technical topics and making them accessible to curious, non-technical audiences. Over the years, this has fueled my growth in communication and writing. I enjoy crafting blog posts, leading workshops, and diving into one-on-one sessions to explain and explore technology in simple, relatable ways.
