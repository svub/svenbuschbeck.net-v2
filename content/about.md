## The Story
I still remember that massive book my brother gave for my twelve's birthday. Back when going online involved a modem and Netscape Communicator. Thanks to the book and some funny ideas in my head as motivation, I learned JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create my first interactive websites in the mid 90s. That was the initial spark that has lead to studying computer science with a mix of graphic design and usability engineering. While hacking away on uni assignments and little open source side projects, I started working on designing and building a CMS for a small web agency to pay my bills. Being curious about living and working abroad, I then took a junior researcher position at the [University of Trento](unitn.it/en) in Italy in 2007. After two years, I changed to work as research engineer at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://dfki.de/en/web) in Germany. I learned a lot during that time but also realized that I'm not a 9-5er office person. Thus, in 2013, I started working as a freelance web technology consultant &amp; developer and gathered experience in marketing, technical writing, and communications. And just before the bull market was in full swing, I started my deep dive into crypto and at its peak in 2017, I joined the [Nimiq Project](https://nimiq.com) as full time contractor. 

I can say that throughout my career, I've experienced a wide range of projects, teams, frameworks, and  management approaches. I worked with privately held companies, universities, research centers, start-ups, as well as NGOs/NPOs. I learned that it's key to work for what you believe in and that the working culture is at least as important as the software stack. While moving through projects, I also moved through countries and continents and became an avid traveler with a love for refreshing my synapses by immersing into new cultures and ideas. So, during the years I lived in Germany, Italy, Greece, Australia, Taiwan, and Costa Rica and understood what a beautiful and colorful place our little planet is. It's at the core of my personality to seek for harmony within myself, with friends, colleagues, and nature as a whole.
