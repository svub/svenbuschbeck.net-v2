# Scaling images for the web--easily and quickly

Starting Gimp just to scale down some photos to send them by mail? Meh. 
How about mark them, right-click, "Send To" -> "Scale for web"?
That would be nice. 
Let's code it!

First, get a tool to scale images:

```sh
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

Now, create a script that takes a list of images as input, scales them down, and stores them with a prefixed file name. Go!

```sh
#!/bin/bash
pwd > ~/f0.txt
echo "$@" > ~/f1.txt
for file in $@
do
	convert "$file" -quality 50 -resize 1024x768 "${file%/*}/web-${file##*/}"
done
```

Make sure toÂ `chmod +x`Â the script file we just created.
Next, let's integrate it into "Send To". This is an example for Thunar on XFCE.
Create aÂ `.desktop`Â file in theÂ `sendto`Â folder, e.g.Â `/usr/share/Thunar/sendto/scale-for-web.desktop`Â with following content:

```sh
# Scale images for the web
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
TryExec=scale-for-web
Exec=scale-for-web %F
Icon=
Name=Scale for the web
MimeType=image/jpeg;image/jpg;image/png
```

Replace bothÂ `scale-for-web`Â with the name you gave to your script file. Is the script's folder inÂ `$PATH`? No idea? Then just put the entire path+filename.

Now, open Thunar, select some images (Jpeg or Png), right-click, "Send To" -> "Scale for the web", wait a few seconds and you'll seeÂ `web-....jpg`Â files appearing in the same folder. ðŸ™‚
