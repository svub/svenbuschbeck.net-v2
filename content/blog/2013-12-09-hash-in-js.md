# Hash in JS

Generating hashes from strings can be very handy. Surprisingly, in JavaScript, an arithmetic-operation-based algorithm is about *three times* faster than one using bit-wise operators--[see for yourself (archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20150909102006/http://jsperf.com/hashing-strings/22 "Performance comparison of five hashing methods showing drastic differences."). I suggested to add the most performant method as [hash method to underscore.string.js](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/pull/247 "hash method for underscore.string.js").

The code is simple:

```js

  hash: function (str) {
    var hash = 0, len = str.length
    if (len == 0) return hash;
    for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) { 
      hash = hash * 31 + str.charCodeAt(i); 
    }
    return hash;
  }
```

It might be time to end [statements on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7616461/generate-a-hash-from-string-in-javascript-jquery "Stack Overflow page with this statement") along the lines of...

> `hash << 5 - hash` is the same as `hash * 31 + char` but a LOT faster.

In times of interpreted languages and virtual machines one should reconsider if applying the same old rules still makes sense.

p.s.  I was very surprised that the neat reduce-based version failed so miserably.
