    Hi there! I’m Sven. I work as a web technology consultant, project manager, full-stack developer, and technical writer, supporting projects worldwide both remotely and on-site. I’m passionate about applied technologies, a firm believer in the power of Open Source, and deeply enthusiastic about photography, writing, planning, communication, nature, and traveling—and yes, even bookkeeping has a special place in my heart.

  - title: AI

      AI is the driving force behind the next major revolution. As our computational machines are evolving into thinking machines,  tasks that once seemed nearly impossible to code are now within reach. On the flipside, we must embrace some level of uncertainty. We’re only beginning to explore this vast new frontier. AI holds immense potential &mdash; not just in enhancing user interactions, but also for automatization and in streamlining data integration, consolidation, and deduplication. Working in this field is exciting, at times it feels like wizardry.

      I entered the space in 2017 joining the <a href="https://nimiq.com" target="_blank">Nimiq</a> project. My work focused on front-end development (e.g., <a href="https://fastspot.io/" target="_blank">Fastspot</a>, <a href="https://www.nimiq.com/staking-calculator/" target="_blank">Staking Calculator</a>) and <a href="https://www.nimiq.com/blog/ target="_blank">content creation</a>. Distributed ledger technology, despite all its shortcomings, has immense potential to transform our societies through decentralized finance, distributed autonomous organizations, private transactions, sound money, and the power of immutability and trustlessness, to name a few. The underlying technologies (L1, L2, L0, ZKPs, side chains, encryption, etc.) are both powerful and fascinating.

      The web is constantly evolving, a living and ever-changing ecosystem. Over the years, I've worked with numerous frameworks, languages, and meta-languages. Every successful project begins with a strong idea, a powerful framework, top-tier usability/UX, and clear, extensible code and infrastructure. I’m a big fan of Vue.js with TypeScript, HTML/Pug, and Sass/Stylus. Recently, I’ve been exploring Web3 technologies.
  - title: Content

      I have a passion for breaking down complex technical topics and making them accessible to curious, non-technical audiences. Over the years, this has fueled my growth in communication and writing. I enjoy crafting blog posts, leading workshops, and diving into one-on-one sessions to explain and explore technology in simple, relatable ways.
  - title: Usability

      What’s the point of technology if it doesn’t serve its users? This question has been my guiding principle since my university days. It drives me to find the ideal balance between features, security, performance, and usability.
