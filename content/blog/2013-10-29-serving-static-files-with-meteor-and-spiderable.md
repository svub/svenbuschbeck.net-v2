# Serving Static Files with Meteor and Spiderable

In short: To serve files which are not part of your project's code (i.e. which are supposed to be served without being compiled), put them in theÂ `public`Â folder. This folder will be served fromÂ `/`.

Some more background and details: Trying to add a web-font to my project, I put it inÂ `/client/webfonts/somefont.woff`. But the font didn't show up. I tested it withÂ `wget -O- http://localhost:3000/webfonts/somefont.woff`Â ... and *surprise* I got the HTML of the default page--not some binary gibberish that you would expect to find in a font file.

All file types unknown to meteor get stripped out during compile time. Instead you need to put them in a separate folder calledÂ `public`--in my case inÂ `/public/webfonts/somefont.woff`. Rookie mistake I guess. ðŸ™‚
